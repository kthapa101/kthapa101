## Hi there 👋

I am a graduate student at Cell and Molecular Biology Department, Tulane University. I am interested to learn more about bioinformatics. My hobbies include watching soccer, writing poems (I also used to draw sketches but after I started PhD, have not have chance to do that. No surprise 😁).
